# Java-HackerRank-Hands-on

/*

Here you'll  find Java codes related to 
the challenges available on hacker rank under the title  
"30 Days of Code" and some other Random Java challenges or 
Coding questions related to Java with suitabble title.
My only advice is to use it only as a reference and not to 
copy it! As this code will  be available always but you can
learn it only by practice and practice alone, as well said that
"Therre is no  alternative to hard work."
Try your best if you're struck, refer the code and again try
it on your own.
All the best with your practice!
